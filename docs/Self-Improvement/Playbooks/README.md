# Playbooks (Draft)

This folder is the **document-first staging area** for turning probabilistic agent output into trusted operational decisions.

## Current Intent

- Capture fast hypotheses quickly.
- Refine them through structured follow-up.
- Validate with adversarial review and an independent judge.
- Convert accepted outcomes into deterministic operational playbooks.

## Pipeline

1. **Fast answers** (multiple independent experts)
2. **Refined answer** (deeper pass over open questions)
3. **Validated + scored answers** (adversarial committee + independent judge)
4. **Promotion decision**
   - Promote to trusted playbook
   - Quarantine for more data
   - Reject with rationale
