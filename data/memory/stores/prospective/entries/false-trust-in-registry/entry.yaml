problem_statement: >-
  Certified registry entries can fail in real runtime contexts due to dependency,
  environment, or policy drift while still appearing trusted.
assumption: Trust must be continuously validated at runtime, not inferred from registry status alone.
evidence_needed: certified-skill runtime failure rate by environment delta.
