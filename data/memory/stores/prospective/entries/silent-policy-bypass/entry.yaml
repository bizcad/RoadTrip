problem_statement: >-
  Some users and agents will intentionally or accidentally route around policy controls.
  If bypass occurs without an explicit event trail, governance fails silently while
  outcomes can still appear successful.
assumption: Detectable enforcement boundaries + explicit bypass telemetry reduces silent drift.
evidence_needed: policy-gate coverage rate, bypass event count, and unlogged bypass count.
