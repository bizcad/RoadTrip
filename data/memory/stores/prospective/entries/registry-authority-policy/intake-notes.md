# Intake Notes — Second Brain to Prospective Memory

Nate Jones' 'second brain' framing seeded this trail: capture random ideas quickly, classify them, and return an actionable list later.

RoadTrip extension:
- Keep fast-thinking capture cheap.
- Attach provenance and supporting docs immediately.
- Route items into slow-thinking review with paired validation.
- Produce explicit decision outcomes:
  - target_promote
  - target_quarantine
  - target_reject

Initial policy sketch:
1. Candidate intake is open (external and internal sources).
2. Trusted registry mutation is controlled (paired review + evidence).
3. Preview paths are allowed but cannot become default without vetting.
