problem_statement: >-
  External change velocity (dependencies, CDN, upstream fixes) can break trusted
  execution paths. We need clear authority boundaries for Registry writes.
policy_thesis:
  - Outsiders may submit candidates, but cannot directly mutate trusted registry entries.
  - Trusted registry changes require vetting evidence and paired review.
  - Preview usage is opt-in and never default routing.
required_fields:
  - assumption
  - evidence_needed
  - review_by
  - decision
assumption: Authority control is required to preserve trust under ecosystem churn.
evidence_needed: Reduction in break/fallback incidents after authority gating.

  This is linked to the 'second brain' inspiration, but extended for
  prospective-memory with attached supporting docs for slow-thinking review.
