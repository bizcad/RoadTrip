problem_statement: >-
  If verification mode/config is weak or inconsistent, modified code can be
  trusted incorrectly and bypass expected controls.
assumption: Fingerprint enforcement has blind spots in real-world drift scenarios.
evidence_needed: mismatch incidents, bypass-path detections, and false-accept rates.

initial_hypotheses:
  - Fingerprint generation scope excludes critical dependency/config state.
  - Mock/real verification modes can diverge in behavior.
  - Registry fingerprints can become stale without periodic revalidation.
