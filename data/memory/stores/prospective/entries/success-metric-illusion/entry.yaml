problem_statement: >-
  Surface success (benchmarks, pretty outputs, headline pass rates) can optimize
  public perception while failing user purpose. This is especially dangerous for
  asymmetric-risk tasks where one miss (for example doctor/bank mail) has much
  higher cost than many routine successes.
assumption: Purpose-weighted and harm-weighted metrics outperform aggregate pass-rate metrics.
evidence_needed: critical-miss rate, harm-weighted error score, and intervention-required rate by task tier.
