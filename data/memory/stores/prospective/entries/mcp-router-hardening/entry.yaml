problem_statement: >-
  External MCP server traffic can expand attack surface and leak privileged
  internal capabilities unless routed through a hardened control point.
assumption: >-
  A dedicated MCP router host with strict ingress policy and segmented network
  boundaries reduces exploit blast radius and limits direct exposure of
  internal skills.
evidence_needed: >-
  Reduced direct external access paths to internal tools, successful blocked
  unauthorized connection attempts, and no regression in approved MCP workflows.

notes: >-
  Seed concept from Rocky Lhotka MCP Aggregator thread and Bizcad plan to host
  the router on an isolated iMac with explicit path controls back to the main
  Windows development system. Combined with Registry policy controls, this
  enables dual-layer separation: network boundary enforcement plus app-level
  capability/routing governance.
