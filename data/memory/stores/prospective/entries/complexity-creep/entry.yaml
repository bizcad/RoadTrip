problem_statement: >-
  Systems naturally accumulate controls, memories, and artifacts faster than they remove them.
  Human preference also trends toward retention. Without explicit hard limits, complexity
  and storage usage drift upward until reliability, performance, and usability degrade.
assumption: Hard resource budgets + mandatory auto-pruning outperform discretionary/manual cleanup.
evidence_needed: storage-budget adherence rate, prune efficiency, and complexity trend after policy enforcement.
