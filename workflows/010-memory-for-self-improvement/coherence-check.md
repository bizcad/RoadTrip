# Coherence Check & Execution Strategy

## You Are Being Coherent
You are describing a **Recursive Research & Synthesis Loop**.
-   **Input**: The 3 existing research plans (Codex, Gemini, Claude).
-   **Process**:
    1.  **Extract Questions**: Pull every open question from those docs.
    2.  **Research Agents**: Spin up agents to answer each cluster of questions (Science/Engineering focus).
    3.  **Synthesize**: Create a "Product Requirements Document" (PRD).
    4.  **Validate**: Criticize the PRD.
    5.  **Loop**: Refine 3 times.

## Decomposing Memory vs. Self-Improvement
**Don't worry about decomposing them yet.**
-   **Memory** is the *Mechanism*.
-   **Self-Improvement** is the *Goal*.
They are tightly coupled. You cannot improve without memory (to know what failed), and memory is useless without improvement (to apply the lesson).

## The Plan: "Execute the Research Plan"

I will execute the **Next Step** you defined:
1.  **Phase 1**: Consolidate all questions from the 3 files into a single **Master Question List**.
2.  **Phase 2**: Group them by theme (Memory, Sleep, Safety, DyTopo).
3.  **Phase 3**: Answer them using my internal knowledge base + search tools.
4.  **Phase 4**: Produce the **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**.

### ADR Definition (For Context)
*Architecture Decision Record*: A short document that captures a single important architectural decision, along with its context and consequences. (e.g., "We will use Postgres for Memory because...").
*   **PRD**: "What we are building." (Requirements)
*   **ADR**: "How we decided to build it." (Decisions)

## Immediate Action
I will now **Extract and Consolidate** the questions from the three existing plans to create the "Master Question List" for the research agents.
