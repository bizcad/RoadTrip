# DSL Terminology (Draft v0.1)

## Naming Goal

Use terms that support long-term expansion of trust features (provenance, cryptographic privacy, attestation) while staying understandable for operators.

---

## Top-level language

- **Supply Chain Trust Pipeline**: admission path for skills/MCPs before autonomous use
- **Trusted Admission Gate**: deterministic gate that decides `allow`, `manual_review`, or `block`
- **Trust Manifest**: per-capability record of gate decisions and evidence links
- **Pre-Execution Verification**: runtime checks before invocation

---

## Workflow graph terms

- **Workflow**: a typed directed graph of executable nodes
- **Node**: one executable capability invocation (`skill.*` or `mcp.*`)
- **Edge**: a typed connection carrying data or control
- **Port**: named node input/output contract endpoint
- **Artifact**: persisted output generated by node execution (files, logs, snapshots)
- **Checkpoint**: rollback-safe boundary in execution timeline
- **Commit Barrier**: explicit boundary before irreversible side effects
- **Compensation Step**: optional inverse/remediation action for post-commit failures

---

## Node intent classes

- **prob node**: planning/suggestion/interpretation (non-authoritative)
- **deter node**: deterministic action execution (authoritative)

Interpretation:
- Prob hierarchy refines vague intent into candidate graph structures.
- Deter leaves execute admitted capabilities under strict policy.

---

## Effect classes

- **pure**: no side effects, replay safe
- **staged**: writes temporary state/artifacts only, safe to drop before commit
- **committing**: writes durable state but reversible with compensation
- **irreversible**: destructive or non-recoverable effect; requires elevated safeguards

---

## Failure terms

- **fatal failure**: error that halts run immediately
- **drop-to-checkpoint**: discard staged operations since last checkpoint
- **quarantine**: isolate node/capability from autonomous path until re-vetted
- **drift warning**: trusted metadata or introspection changed; downgrade to manual review

---

## MCP-specific terminology

- **introspection snapshot**: captured MCP self-description at trust time
- **snapshot hash**: deterministic hash of introspection payload
- **soft pin**: allow evolution but warn/downgrade on drift
- **hard pin**: require exact snapshot match for autonomous execution
